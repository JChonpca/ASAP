# DNA Chain AFM Simulation and U-Net Parameter Guide

This README explains the main parameters that can be changed in
`Simulation_of_DNA_chain_with_U_Net.ipynb` and describes how each parameter
is expected to affect the generated data, the U-Net training process, and the
final model output.

The notebook has two connected parts:

1. **DNA-chain AFM simulation** — generates synthetic AFM images, DNA masks,
   crossing masks, and per-sample metadata.
2. **DeepTrack/Deeplay U-Net workflow** — loads generated samples through
   DeepTrack sources, trains a two-channel U-Net, validates it, and optionally
   evaluates it on real test data.

The U-Net output channels are:

| Channel | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | DNA segmentation logits |
| `1` | Crossing logits |

## Recommended tuning order

For model output quality, the most influential settings are usually:

1. `N_SAMPLES`, `BEAD_COUNTS`, and AFM rendering/noise settings
2. `BG_Q` and `HIGH_Q`
3. `TRAIN_CFG["cross_loss_weight"]` and
   `TRAIN_CFG["cross_pos_weight"]`
4. `TRAIN_CFG["dna_pos_weight"]`
5. `TRAIN_CFG["lr"]` and `TRAIN_CFG["max_epochs"]`
6. `MODEL_CFG["channels"]`
7. `TARGET_SIZE`
8. Evaluation thresholds in `dice_score_from_prob` and
   `iou_score_from_prob`

## Execution mode and dependencies

| Parameter | Current value | What it controls | Effect of changing it |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `USE_MD` | `True` | Whether OpenMM molecular dynamics is used for chain relaxation. | `True` gives more physically motivated chains but is slower and may require OpenMM. `False` uses the faster persistent-walk fallback. |
| `SAMPLE_TIMEOUT_S` | `10.0` | Maximum allowed time per generated sample before the seed is skipped. | Increasing it allows slower MD samples to complete. Decreasing it skips expensive or unstable seeds sooner. |

## Common tuning recipes

### Improve DNA recall

Increase the positive-class weight for DNA pixels:

```python
TRAIN_CFG["dna_pos_weight"] = 2.0  # or 4.0
```

You can also lower the prediction threshold during evaluation, for example
from `0.5` to `0.4`.

### Reduce DNA false positives

Decrease the DNA positive-class weight:

```python
TRAIN_CFG["dna_pos_weight"] = 1.0
```

You can also increase the evaluation threshold from `0.5` to `0.6`. Small
isolated false positives can be removed during postprocessing.

### Make crossings less important

Decrease the global crossing task weight:

```python
TRAIN_CFG["cross_loss_weight"] = 0.05
```

This keeps the network focused on DNA segmentation.

### Prevent crossing collapse to zero

Increase the positive crossing-pixel weight:

```python
TRAIN_CFG["cross_pos_weight"] = 20.0  # or 50.0
```

If the crossing head starts tracing the whole DNA chain, reduce this value or
add an explicit penalty for false crossing predictions on non-crossing DNA.

### Make simulated DNA look more like real AFM data

Tune these settings together:

```python
BG_Q
HIGH_Q
TARGET_NOISE_RMS_NM
tip_radius
nm_per_px
AFM_KW["final_blur_sigma_px"]
AFM_KW["ridge_amp_nm"]
```

These control contrast, noise, width, blur, and ridge strength.

## Notes on portability

- `USE_MD=True` requires OpenMM. This can be slower and more
  platform-specific.
- `TRAIN_CFG["num_workers"] = 0` is the safest setting for Windows, macOS,
  and notebooks using DeepTrack sources.
- The trainer uses CUDA mixed precision only when CUDA is available. Apple
  Silicon MPS and CPU use `32-true` precision.
- Real-test matching depends on file and folder names. If no samples are
  found, update `IMAGE_KEYWORDS`, `DNA_MASK_KEYWORDS`, and
  `CROSS_MASK_KEYWORDS`.
